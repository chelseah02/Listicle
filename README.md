## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
I am currently challenged with linking the detail page of each recipe. Right now it is a blank page with you click Read More. I will continue working on this until the 72 hours deadline passes.

9/25/2023 Update: Required feature including details page complete. I solved this challenge by fixing the routing paths in the router file and also paths when linking the header.js and recipe.js files in recipe.html.
